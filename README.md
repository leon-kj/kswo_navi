## Starting the application
Start the VITE frontend server with `npm start` for a dev server. The server should be available under [https://localhost:5173](https://localhost:5173).  
Start the backend with `node server/server.js`. Note that the backend won't get access to a database, as the db is locally running on my personal machine.
